#### Bio

I am a third-year bachelor student in Psychology at the University of Bern, with Neurosciences and Biology being my Minors. My greatest research interests are in the domains of neuroscience, sleep, cognition, and perception. In the lab, I conduct high-density EEG recordings studying auditory predictive processes in sleep and wakefulness and perform sleep scoring.
